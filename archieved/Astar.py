    Arguments:

      neighbors(pos) - A function returning all neighbor positions of the given
                       position.
      goal(pos)      - A function returning true given a goal position, false
                       otherwise.
      start_g        - The starting cost.
      cost(a, b)     - A function returning the cost for moving from one
                       position to another.
      heuristic(pos) - A function returning an estimate of the total cost
                       remaining for reaching goal from the given position.
                       Overestimates can yield suboptimal paths.
      limit          - The maximum number of positions to search.
      debug(nodes)   - This function will be called with a dictionary of all
                       nodes.

    The function returns the best path found. The returned path excludes the
